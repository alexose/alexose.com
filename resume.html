            <p>
                I'm a full-stack, JavaScript-forward developer seeking a position that inspires creative uses of
                technology.&nbsp; Freedom to learn, evolve, experiment, and (occasionally) fail is important to me.
            </p>

            <h2>Technologies</h2>
            <p>
                JavaScript, ES6, React, React Native, Redux, Node.js, Express, Angular, d3.js, Jest, Enzyme, Cypress.io,
                Nightwatch.js, Webpack, Yarn, npm, Firebase, Meteor, EC2, S3, ELB, Elasticsearch, CloudWatch,

            </p>

            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <h3>Automattic, Inc. Senior Frontend Engineer. 2/19 &ndash; Present.&nbsp;</h3>
            <p>
                I joined Automattic via Parse.ly, which was acquired shortly after my arrival. Parse.ly is a
                first-in-class analytics service aimed at large publishers.
            </p>
            <p>
                At Automattic, I've been designing, validating, and delivering high-value features based on identified 
                customer needs.  This has made use of almost every skill I have: Conducting user interviews, rapid 
                prototyping, production-izing proven ideas, and advocacting internally across frontend, backend, and
                ops to continuously push the pace.
            <p>
            </p>
                I've also taken special interest in improving our developer experience as our team continues to grow.
                I've improved the tooling with a special eye on automation, and smoothed out as many rough edges as I
                can find in the legacy codebase.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <h3>ThreatSwitch, Inc. Senior Frontend Engineer. 11/17 &ndash; 1/19.&nbsp;</h3>
            <p>
                ThreatSwitch helps companies stay compliant with industrial security regulations. Our product is a
                user-friendly cloud application (built around React.js, Redux, and Rails) aimed at facility security
                officers.
            </p>
            <p>
                I took over the frontend code in November of 2017, and helped deliver several major revisions. What
                started as a rough prototype is now a feature-complete platform with comprehensive unit and integration
                tests, cleanly abstracted components, and a build environment that makes it easy for new developers to
                hit the ground running.
            </p>
            <p>
                Drawing on my experience in government, I brought human-centered design techniques to our process. The
                focus on early validation and usability testing allows us to deliver more value with less development
                time.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <h3>United States Digital Service, Digital Services Expert. 10/15 &ndash; 03/17.&nbsp;</h3>
            <p>
                The U.S. Digital Service uses the best of product design and engineering practices to transform the way
                government works for the American people.
            </p>
            <p>
                I worked for the Social Security Administration to help build the next version of the Disability Claims
                Processing System using a modern stack. Originally a six-year, $288 million project, we were able to
                produce a release candidate in just over one year for a fraction of the cost.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also helped deploy Vets.gov, which allows veterans to sign up for their earned benefits. With an
                innovative user-centric design and a focus on best practices, we showed that the public sector can
                produce quality software even in a nontechnical agency.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <h3>Crimson Hexagon, Inc., Boston, MA. UI Engineer. 05/14 &ndash; 09/15.&nbsp;</h3>
            <p>
                Crimson Hexagon uses machine learning techniques to make sense of a vast amount of social data. &nbsp;As
                one of the few companies with access to the full Twitter firehose, it offered a unique opportunity to
                work on data visualization at scale.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a UI engineer, I turned customer needs into usable, modular, and maintainable code. This process took
                many forms: From user research, prototyping, and validation, to implementation and long-term support.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <h3>Sourcemap Inc., Cambridge, MA. Product Engineer. 11/11 &ndash; 02/14.&nbsp;</h3>
            <p>
                Sourcemap helps companies understand their supply chains through data acquisition and visualization.
                &nbsp;I lead the development of the Sourcemap UI and created the majority of its visualizations,
                including the eponymous map. &nbsp;The map uses some clever techniques to be both fast and beautiful:
                Web workers, geographic indexing, and one-way data binding with d3.js.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also created window.js, which is a tiling window manager implemented in JavaScript. &nbsp;We use this
                to create dynamic dashboards that our clients use to display all sorts of data.
            </p>
            <p>
                Early on, I was also the system administrator. &nbsp;I ran the first version of the software, which was
                public-facing and often experienced spikes of 50,000 uniques per day. &nbsp;I helped stop our early
                downtime issues with a combination of caching (using memcached and Squid), as well as better tests,
                monitoring, and alerts.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <h3>MIT Media Lab, Cambridge, MA. &nbsp;UI Design&nbsp;Contractor. 04/11 &ndash; 10/11.</h3>
            <p>
                I was hired on to the MIT Media Lab as a UI generalist, where I began working on the project that would
                become Sourcemap. I helped wireframe the early stages of the project, and designed the first version of
                the UI.
            </p>
            <p>Some of my other responsibilities included:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Creating CSS and image assets for the site</li>
                <li>Optimizing, debugging, and otherwise improving the existing JavaScript architecture</li>
                <li>
                    Orchestrating a change from Subversion to Git, and a subsequent push to publish our code on GitHub
                    under the AGPL
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <h3>Alex Ose Modern Media, Portland, OR. 04/08 &ndash; Present.</h3>
            <p>
                I used to make websites for small business and non-profits on a freelance basis. I continue to operate
                Alex Ose Modern Media, although I do not accept new clients. My general responsibilities included:
            </p>
            <ul>

                <li>Advocating F/OSS and making freely licenced contributions wherever possible</li>
            </ul>
